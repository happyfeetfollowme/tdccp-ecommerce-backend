  // What to test:
  // - Payment processing with various payment methods
  // - Handling successful and failed transactions
  // - Refund processing
  // - Integration with external payment gateways
  // - Idempotency of payment requests

  // What to mock:
  // - External payment gateway APIs (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)
  // - Database interactions (Prisma) for transaction records
  // - Order service (for updating order status after payment)

  it('should successfully process a credit card payment', () => {
    // Test case: Simulate a successful credit card transaction.
    // Mock: External payment gateway API.
  });

  it('should handle failed payment attempts gracefully', () => {
    // Test case: Simulate a declined credit card or other payment failure.
    // Mock: External payment gateway API to return an error.
  });

  it('should process a full refund for a given transaction', () => {
    // Test case: Initiate a refund for a previously successful payment.
    // Mock: External payment gateway API for refunds.
  });

  it('should ensure payment requests are idempotent', () => {
    // Test case: Send the same payment request multiple times and verify only one transaction is processed.
    // Mock: Database to check for duplicate transactions.
  });

  it('should update order status in order service upon successful payment', () => {
    // Test case: Verify that the order service is notified and updates the order status.
    // Mock: Order service API.
  });
