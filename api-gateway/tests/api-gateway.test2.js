  // What to test:
  // - Routing to different services
  // - Authentication and authorization
  // - Rate limiting
  // - Error handling for upstream service failures
  // - Request/response transformations

  // What to mock:
  // - Upstream service calls (e.g., product-service, user-service)
  // - Authentication provider
  // - Rate limiting mechanism

  it('should correctly route requests to the product service', () => {
    // Test case: Verify that requests to /products are forwarded to the product service.
    // Mock: Product service response.
  });

  it('should reject unauthenticated requests', () => {
    // Test case: Ensure requests without valid authentication tokens are rejected.
    // Mock: Authentication service/middleware.
  });

  it('should apply rate limiting to prevent abuse', () => {
    // Test case: Verify that too many requests from a single client are blocked.
    // Mock: Rate limiting counter/store.
  });

  it('should handle errors gracefully when a service is unavailable', () => {
    // Test case: Simulate a downstream service failure and check the API gateway's error response.
    // Mock: Downstream service to return an error.
  });

  it('should transform request bodies as expected', () => {
    // Test case: Verify that the API gateway modifies the request body before forwarding.
    // Mock: Downstream service to receive the transformed request.
  });
