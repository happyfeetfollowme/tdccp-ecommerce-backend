  // What to test:
  // - Order creation with valid/invalid data
  // - Retrieving orders by user or order ID
  // - Updating order status
  // - Handling out-of-stock scenarios
  // - Integration with payment and product services

  // What to mock:
  // - Database interactions (Prisma)
  // - Calls to product service (for stock checks)
  // - Calls to payment service (for transaction processing)
  // - User authentication/authorization context

  it('should successfully create a new order with valid items', () => {
    // Test case: Create an order with existing products and a valid user.
    // Mock: Database insert, product service stock check.
  });

  it('should prevent order creation with out-of-stock items', () => {
    // Test case: Attempt to create an order with products that are out of stock.
    // Mock: Product service to indicate out of stock.
  });

  it('should retrieve all orders for a specific user', () => {
    // Test case: Fetch orders associated with a given user ID.
    // Mock: Database query for orders.
  });

  it('should update the status of an existing order', () => {
    // Test case: Change an order's status (e.g., from pending to shipped).
    // Mock: Database update.
  });

  it('should integrate with the payment service for successful transactions', () => {
    // Test case: Verify that a successful payment leads to order confirmation.
    // Mock: Payment service to return success.
  });
